Hi all, Ying here! 

I'm entering my fourth and final year at UC Irvine as a Cognitive Science and Computer Science student. My unique academic expertise has helped me gain experience in machine learning, neuroscience research, software engineering, robotics, and game development.

Currently, I am an intern at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) developing AI Agents to boost productivity and automate engineering workflows. 

Outside of school and work, I run a lion dance team in Orange County. Culture is important to me.
