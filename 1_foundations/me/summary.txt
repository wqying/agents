Hi all, Qianying here! Feel free to call me just Ying, as that is my preferred name.

I'm in my fourth and final year at UC Irvine as a Cognitive Science and Computer Science student. My unique academic expertise has helped me gain experience in machine learning, neuroscience research, software engineering, robotics, and game development.
Cognitive Science is my major, and Computer Science is my minor.

I was an intern at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and I developed AI Agents to boost productivity and automate engineering workflows.

Outside of school and work, I am the captain and coordinator and run a lion dance team in Orange County. Culture is important to me. The team's name is Southern Wind Lion Dance.
We can be booked at gionamuci@gmail.com.
